## About

This repository contains the code for **Test Case 3.5 (TC3.5)** developed under **Work Package 4 (WP4)** of the [**ACROSS**](https://across-he.eu/) European research project, funded by the **Horizon Europe** programme. The TC3.5 use case focuses on the applicability of Network Digital Twins (NDTs) for generating synthetic network traffic data to train and validate machine learning models for heavy hitter discrimination — distinguishing between normal traffic, benign heavy hitters, and malicious heavy hitters (e.g., DDoS attacks).

The framework presented here leverages orchestration technologies and automated deployment workflows to create reproducible, extensible, and scalable network environments for security research and experimentation.

## System Architecture

The system architecture is composed of interconnected Docker containers orchestrated via Docker Compose. The architecture leverages Elasticsearch for model cataloging, Kafka for data streaming, and Grafana for monitoring. Below is an overview of the key components and their interactions.

### Key Components

1. **Network Digital Twin (NDT)**: Creates a virtual replica of a real network environment, enabling the generation of extensive and labeled synthetic traffic data suitable for training production-ready ML models for diverse network use cases.
2. **Traffic Generators**: Emulate standard, benign heavy hitter, and malicious heavy hitter (DDoS) traffic.
3. **Data Collection Modules**: Capture network traffic using NFstream and preprocess data into flow snapshots.
4. **Machine Learning Pipeline**: Train and evaluate Random Forest classifiers for traffic classification.
5. **Messaging Bus (Kafka)**: Facilitates communication between components, enabling scalable data streaming.
6. **Monitoring Dashboard (Grafana)**: Visualizes network traffic and ML model performance metrics in real-time.
7. **AI Training Service**: Trains machine learning models using collected and preprocessed data.
8. **AI Detector**: Assigns final classifications based on inference probabilities, using a separate pre-built image.

### Architecture Overview
![System Architecture Diagram](Figures/system_architecture.png)

The above figure illustrates the general architecture. The Mouseworld NDT generates live raw traffic received by the AI Data Aggregator through a customizable number of flow aggregators, ensuring scalability. This raw traffic is aggregated into traffic features and sent through a Kafka bus to the AI Inference component, which is also scalable through replicas. The AI Inference component processes the features using an ML model and outputs the probability of the traffic belonging to each class: normal traffic, benign heavy hitter, and malicious DDoS traffic. These probabilities are sent through the Kafka bus to the AI Detector component, which assigns the final class to each flow based on the probabilities. Currently, the class with the highest probability is assigned, but the system is designed to accept custom thresholds to reduce false positives or negatives for specific classes. Finally, the assigned classes are sent through the Kafka bus to a monitoring client that aggregates the results into a custom Grafana dashboard, providing an easy-to-monitor view of the network state and ML model performance.

###
We have designed MouseWorld as a NDT platform to provide a controlled and reproducible environment for network experimentation, directly supporting the objectives of our research. Aligned with the IETF NDT architecture, MouseWorld leverages Kubernetes Network Emulation (KNE) to create scalable, multi-vendor network topologies and uses Ansible for automated deployment, ensuring flexibility and repeatability in experimentation.

To address the challenges of data scarcity in AI-driven network research, we designed MouseWorld to generate synthetic traffic that accurately replicates real-world user behavior. This enables the creation of high-fidelity datasets for training and validating ML models in network performance optimization and security analysis.

MouseWorld is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster comprising three control nodes and three worker nodes. The control nodes manage cluster operations and ensure resource allocation, while the worker nodes host network emulation instances. Each worker node is equipped with Docker container runtime and Kubernetes networking components to support high-performance traffic processing. The deployment integrates KNE for orchestrating virtualized network devices, enabling multivendor emulation with support for Arista, Cisco, Juniper, and Nokia devices. Traffic data is collected and stored for analysis, with results visualized in Grafana for monitoring and evaluation.

![Kubernetes Cluster](Figures/kubernetes_cluster.png)

## Scenario Configuration and Deployment

The [scenario](Figures/topology.png) was implemented using the KNE platform within Mouseworld NDT, incorporating routers, clients, and servers. A total of 30 clients were deployed in this scenario. Among these, 21 clients are configured to emulate benign traffic, while the remaining 9 clients are designed to emulate DDoS attacks. Below the diagram of the topology is provided:

![Scenario Topology](Figures/topology.png)

### Network Topology and Traffic Routing
The scenario employs Arista’s cEOS 4.32.1F image to emulate routers with predefined configurations. Ten interconnected routers form the topology's core, linking all clients and managing traffic to designated endpoints. Two traffic types are generated, each following a distinct route through the network. The topology was designed so that all traffic classes converge on a single core link (highlighted in orange in the figure). This design choice emulates a typical production network environment where mixed traffic types flow through common links in the core of a network, essential for training a reliable ML model by enabling it to learn discriminative patterns among diverse traffic types on a shared path. Network probes are deployed in all network links to capture traffic data in PCAP files.

### Configuration of Clients and Servers

The client environment is based on a customized Docker image derived from "Ubuntu 18.04." The primary modifications to this image involve the installation of specific packages and libraries required to execute various network attacks effectively. Two distinct Docker images were developed: one for generating benign traffic and another dedicated to generating DDoS attack traffic. For the servers, two separate Docker images based on "Ubuntu 20.04" were configured. The first image is designed to serve as an authoritative DNS server, as well as processing attack-related queries and enabling execution of HTTP flood and DoH attacks. The second server image is configured for client-server socket communication using netcat and serves as the target server for non-attack, benign traffic.

### Automated Scenario Deployment with Ansible
To ensure reproducibility and scalability, the entire topology and traffic emulation environment are deployed using **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) methodologies**:  

- **Ansible Playbooks** – Used to automate the deployment of routers, client configurations, and monitoring tools.  
- **Docker Containers** – Ensure isolation of services and seamless execution across different environments.  
- **Kubernetes-based Orchestration** – Supports service management, scalability, and automated recovery of failed components.

Using Ansible, the deployment of the scenario was automated within the lab's Kubernetes cluster. The repository includes the following Ansible playbooks located in the `ansible-playbooks/` directory:

- **mw-deployment.yaml**: Deploys the network topology using KNE, sets up necessary configurations, and initializes the "gateway2" pod.
- **mw-config.yaml**: Configures the deployed pods based on the number of clients specified, sets up routing, initiates traffic captures using nfstream, and initializes essential services like `Bind9` and the Caddy web server.
- **mw-tasks.yaml**: Declares and runs the traffic generators on the deployed clients, allowing customization of execution time and the number of clients involved.
- **mw-undeployment.yaml**: Cleans up the entire deployment by stopping traffic captures, transferring logs to the host machine, and removing all deployed components.

A Python script is provided in the `scripts/` directory to automate the sequential execution of these Ansible playbooks. This script prompts the user to specify the number of clients for each traffic type, facilitating flexibility in configuring the environment for various experimental requirements.

### Data Collection, Preprocessing, and Labeling

An order of 23.7 million packets were collected from the network link analyzed for each of the two NDT scenario executions. For feature extraction, custom plugins on top of the **NFStream** tool were developed to perform flow packet grouping in 0.5-second intervals, extracting several relevant statistical features of the network flows. These aggregated flow statistics are referred to as **snapshots**. The feature set includes:

- **Protocol Type**: TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.
- **Flow Duration**: Time between the first and last packet in both directions.
- **Packet Counts**: Total packets with payload in both directions.
- **Byte Counts**: Total bytes transmitted in both directions.
- **Time Discrepancy**: Difference in observation times between source and destination.
- **Packets per Second**: Number of packets transmitted per second in both directions.
- **Bytes per Second**: Number of bytes transmitted per second in both directions.

Additionally, the **data_aggregator** component can output labeled CSV files for use in training, validation, and testing machine learning models. Labels are assigned based on the known traffic generation sources, facilitating supervised learning.

Finally, labels were assigned to the data based on the nature of each traffic flow for supervised machine learning applications.

To facilitate reproducibility and support further research, several datasets generated from variations of the described NDT scenario, each specifically prepared for different experimental setups, are openly available at [DATASET_URL](https://github.com/yourusername/across-tc-3.5-network-detection/datasets). The dataset used in this study was obtained through post-processing code applied to these variations.

All traffic generation scripts are located in the `traffic-generators/` directory, providing comprehensive tools to emulate various traffic patterns as described above.

---

## Machine Learning Model Development and Evaluation

### Feature Selection

Custom plugins were developed on top of the **NFStream** tool to extract relevant statistical features from network flows. The feature set includes protocol type, flow duration, packet and byte counts, time discrepancies, and transmission rates, among others. These features are crucial for effectively discriminating between different traffic classes.

### Model Training, Validation, and Testing

A **Random Forest** classifier was selected due to its robustness and proven performance in similar tasks.

#### Dataset

- **Training Set**: 7.5 million connection snapshots from one scenario run.
- **Validation Set**: 1.0 million connection snapshots from a separate scenario run.
- **Testing Set**: 7.9 million connection snapshots from another separate scenario run.

#### Model Configuration

- **Number of Estimators**: 20 (optimal trade-off between performance and speed).
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

#### Training Process

Execute the training script with the specified configuration:

```bash
docker-compose up -d ai-training
```

This command starts the AI Training service, which consumes preprocessed traffic data from Kafka, trains the Random Forest classifier using `train.py`, and uploads the trained model to the ai-catalog for inference.

#### Evaluation Results

|Class|Precision|Recall|F1-Score|
|---|---|---|---|
|Normal Traffic|0.9737|0.9961|0.9848|
|Heavy Hitter|0.6858|0.9027|0.7795|
|DDoS Attack|0.9998|0.9946|0.9972|
|**Macro Avg.**|0.8864|0.9645|0.9205|
|**Weighted Avg.**|0.9950|0.9947|0.9948|

**Confusion Matrix:**

||Predicted Normal|Predicted Heavy Hitter|Predicted DDoS Attack|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Normal Traffic**|1.3e+06|978|35,076|
|**Heavy Hitter**|3,848|9,585|543|
|**DDoS Attack**|1,386|55|6.6e+06|

### Analysis

The model demonstrates high precision and recall for both Normal Traffic and DDoS Attack classes, indicating effective classification. The lower F1-Score for the Heavy Hitter class suggests some misclassifications, primarily between benign heavy hitters and normal traffic. However, in cybersecurity applications, minimizing false negatives is often prioritized to ensure threats are not overlooked.

### Training and Testing Code

All scripts related to model training and evaluation are available in the `ai-training/` and `ml_model/` directories. To reproduce the training process:

```bash
cd ai-training
python train.py --config config.yaml
```

Ensure that the training and testing datasets are correctly specified in the configuration file.

   From the root directory of the repository, run:  
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```  
   This command will build (if not already built) and start all services, including `ai-catalog`, `ai-inference`, `ai-training`, `ai-detector`, `data_aggregator`, `model-upload`, `kafka`, and `ai-monitoring`, in detached mode.

2. **Verify Deployment**  
   Check the status of all services to ensure they are running correctly:  
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```  
   You should see all services listed as `Up`.

3. **Access Services**  
   - **Elasticsearch (ai-catalog)**: `http://localhost:9200`  
   - **Kafka**: Accessible on ports `9094` (External) and `9092` (Internal)  
   - **AI Inference**: Handles data classification  
   - **AI Detector**: Assigns final classes based on inference probabilities  
   - **AI Training**: Trains ML models using `train.py`  
   - **Grafana (ai-monitoring)**: `http://localhost:3000`

4. **Access Grafana Dashboard**  
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. Log in with the default credentials (`admin/admin`) and configure your dashboards to visualize relevant metrics.

5. **Customizing Thresholds**  
   The AI Detector component allows customization of thresholds to balance false positives and negatives. Modify the `thresholds.yaml` file to set class-specific confidence levels:  
   ```yaml
   thresholds:
     Normal Traffic: 0.95
     Heavy Hitter: 0.80
     DDoS Attack: 0.99
   ```  
   Apply the changes:  
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart ai-detector
   ```

6. **Stopping Services**  
   If you need to stop the system:  
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```  
   This command stops all running containers. For a clean restart, it is essential to delete volumes associated with the services:  
   ```bash
   docker-compose down --volumes
   ```  
   Deleting volumes ensures a clean slate for data storage, avoiding potential conflicts or residual data from previous deployments.

### Grafana Dashboard

The Grafana dashboard provides real-time visualization of network traffic and ML model performance. Key metrics include:

- **Traffic Volume**: Incoming and outgoing packets and bytes per class.
- **Unique Connections**: Number of unique malign and benign heavy hitter connections.
- **System Security**: Instances of detected attacks.
- **ML Confidence**: Average confidence on the ML predictions.

### Accessing and Printing Logs

Detailed logs are essential for tracing system behavior and diagnosing issues. Follow the instructions below to access logs for each component.

1. **Identify the Container**
    
    List all running containers to find the specific container name.
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose ps
    ```
    
2. **Access Logs**
    
    Use Docker Compose to view logs for a specific service.
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f <service-name>
    ```
    
    For example, to view logs for the `data_aggregator` service:
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f data_aggregator
    ```
    
3. **Stream Logs in Real-Time**
    
    To continuously stream logs, use the `-f` (follow) flag as shown above.

#### Log Aggregation

Logs from all components are aggregated and stored locally within each container. While advanced log management and visualization can be achieved using tools like the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), direct log ingestion and analysis through ELK is not currently provided in this repository. However, integration with Elasticsearch is supported through the ai-catalog service for those who wish to set up their own ELK environment.

## Reproducibility
All scripts and configurations required to replicate the experiments are included in this repository. This includes:
- **Traffic Generation Scripts**: Located in the `traffic-generators/` directory, separated into `benign/` and `malign/` subdirectories for clarity. Under `benign/`, there are further subcategories for `standard/` and `heavy_hitter/` traffic.
- **NDT Configuration and Deployment Playbooks**: Located in the `ansible-playbooks/` directory, containing `mw-deployment.yaml`, `mw-config.yaml`, `mw-tasks.yaml`, and `mw-undeployment.yaml` for automated scenario deployment and management.
- **NFStream Plugins**: Located in the `data_aggregator/data_aggregator/nfstream/plugins/` directory, containing custom plugins for flow statistics extraction.
- **Machine Learning Models Training and Inference Scripts**: Located in the `ai-inference/`, `ai-training/`, and `ml_model/` directories.
- **Attack Detector**: Located in the `ai-detector/` directory, with pre-built images and scripts for final classification.
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Located in the `ai-monitoring/` directory, extending Grafana with custom dashboards.
- **Utility Scripts**: Located in the `scripts/` directories across various components for building, running, and managing services.

Ensure all components are correctly set up and configured as per the [Installation](#installation) and [Usage](#usage) sections.

### Datasets
To facilitate reproducibility and support further research, several datasets generated from variations of the described NDT scenario, each specifically prepared for different experimental setups, are openly available at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/14134646). The dataset used in this study was obtained through post-processing code applied to these variations.
